	<p>Coldbrew Software is my brand for my game projects.</p>

	<p>I started programming in 2008 during a quixotic run at physics grad school. I made a career out of it about a year later. Since then I've found that even the worst day as a code monkey is slightly better than the best day as an academic.</p>

	<p>Usability is my other favorite hobby. I think there are very few situations where an object should make a person feel bad for failing to operate it. When I meet someone new I will eventually give them my talk about the usability of various kinds of door handles. It may be an odd habit, but it means I'm comfortable enough with them to get really weird about doors.</p>

	<p>When I'm not doing anything in particular I'm usually thinking about one or more of the game concepts I've come up with. Many of these will never see the light of day, but it's good practice if nothing else.</p>

	<p>In my spare time I'm developing Chronicles of Ériu, which will be out sometime before the next ice age.</p>
