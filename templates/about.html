	<p>Coldbrew Games is my brand for my spare-time game projects.</p>

	<p>I planned to be a scientist from age 5 until grad school. I started programming in 2008, and made a career out of it about a year later. Since then I've found that even the worst day as a code monkey is slightly better than the best day as an academic.</p>

	<p>In my spare time I'm developing Chronicles of Ã‰riu, which will be out sometime before the next ice age.</p>
